Lord of the Rings SDK Design

Overview

The Lord of the Rings SDK provides a Python interface to interact with the Lord of the Rings API. It allows developers to easily access movie and quote data from the Lord of the Rings universe.
Architecture

The SDK follows a simple client-library design pattern. It encapsulates the logic for making HTTP requests to the Lord of the Rings API and handling the API responses. The SDK utilizes the requests library for making HTTP requests.
Class Structure

The SDK consists of the following classes:

    LordOfTheRingsClient: The main client class that handles the interaction with the Lord of the Rings API. It provides methods to retrieve movie and quote data.
    LordOfTheRingsError: A custom exception class used to handle errors specific to the Lord of the Rings API.

API Documentation

The Lord of the Rings API provides two endpoints that the SDK interacts with:

    /movies: Retrieves information about all movies in the Lord of the Rings universe.
    /quotes: Retrieves quotes from the Lord of the Rings movies.

For both endpoints, the SDK supports optional parameters to filter the results based on movie ID or quote ID.
Design Decisions

    The SDK uses the requests library for its simplicity and widespread usage in making HTTP requests.
    The LordOfTheRingsClient class encapsulates the logic for handling HTTP requests, allowing for easy extensibility in case new API endpoints are added in the future.
    Error handling is centralized within the SDK, with the LordOfTheRingsError class used to raise exceptions for any API-related errors.

Authentication and Authorization

The Lord of the Rings API requires authentication using a bearer token. The LordOfTheRingsClient class expects the bearer token to be provided during initialization.
Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the Lord of the Rings SDK:

from lord_of_the_rings.client import LordOfTheRingsClient

# Initialize the Lord of the Rings client with the bearer token
bearer_token = "your_bearer_token_here"
lotr_client = LordOfTheRingsClient(bearer_token)

# Retrieve all movies
movies = lotr_client.get_movie()
print(movies)

# Retrieve a specific movie by ID
movie_id = "5cd95395de30eff6ebccde5a"
movie = lotr_client.get_movie(movie_id)
print(movie)

# Retrieve all quotes
quotes = lotr_client.get_quote()
print(quotes)

# Retrieve a specific quote by ID
quote_id = "5cd96e05de30eff6ebcceb4e"
quote = lotr_client.get_quote(quote_id)
print(quote)
