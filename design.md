Lord of the Rings SDK Design
Overview

The Lord of the Rings SDK provides a Python interface to interact with the Lord of the Rings API. It allows developers to retrieve movie information, quotes, book information, and book chapters.
SDK Structure

The SDK consists of the following main components:

    lord_of_the_rings.py: This module contains the LordOfTheRingsClient class, which encapsulates the API interactions. It provides methods to retrieve movie, quote, book, and chapter data from the Lord of the Rings API.

    setup.py: This file is used for packaging the SDK as a Python package. It includes the necessary metadata and dependencies.

Usage

To use the Lord of the Rings SDK in your Python project, follow these steps:

    Install the SDK by running pip install lord_of_the_rings_sdk.gz

    Import the LordOfTheRingsClient class from the lord_of_the_rings module.

    Create an instance of the LordOfTheRingsClient class with your bearer token.

    Use the available methods of the client to interact with the Lord of the Rings API and retrieve the desired data.

Error Handling

The SDK includes an LordOfTheRingsError class to handle errors related to the API. It is raised when an API request returns a non-200 status code. The error class contains the status code and error message received from the API.
